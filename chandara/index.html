                <p>Hello everyone, my name is Chandara Seth (in Khmer: Seth Chandara). I am 16 years old. I was born in
                  a province in Cambodia called Kampong Chhnang. I lived there for about ten years and enjoy what I do
                  there. When I was 12 years old, I got a free scholarship to come and study in Phnom Penh(the capital
                  city of Cambodia) which I am proud to get a chance go study their as a junior high school student.</p>

              <div class="content-hide">
                <p>It's my first time coming to study in a private school in the city. I am a self-learner. Programming
                  is one of the subjects in my school, and I don't like it. Studying there for three years, I moved to
                  another private school in the same city but the schedules, curriculums, and subjects are almost the
                  same as government school. Since then, I am so interested in Web Developing which requires
                  programming. I spent a lot of my free time doing research, and take online courses to study
                  programming, and here this blog today, was made by me inspired by online sources with HTML+CSS and
                  Javascript. I hope you like reading my blog and explore more about me and what I do.</p>

                <p>The goals of creating this blog are:

                  <li>About myself</li>
                  <li>My experience</li>
                  <li>Subjects in my school</li>
                  I created this blog to see
                  how much I can understand and create during my self-learning at home. It is
                  not
                  use for any profits or benefits, I just want to create to share something with the readers like you.
                  And notice that I didn't write down everything by myself, I also got the support from the internet,
                  and a sample from a website too and I want to give a big credit to TEMPLATEMO.

              <p>I felt now, my English is pretty good, I know that there are more words or things that I can expore,
                but I don't have too. I am able to write, read, listen and speak so I don't really need to focus on this

              <p>Physics is also one of my least favorite subjects in school. It is as hard as chemistry, which it
                requires memorizing the formulars and you need to be good at math in order to be good at this.
